<h3 align="left">About Me</h3>
<p align="left">
I'm a passionate and detail-oriented software development enthusiast currently studying at CodeSpace Academy, working towards earning my Software Development certificate, which I anticipate receiving in December. My journey into the world of code began with a strong interest in various areas of technology, including cars, gaming, fashion, and the world of Movies/Shows/YouTube.

🚗🎮👕🎥

My skills currently include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm continuously expanding my knowledge in these languages. The synergy between my interests and programming is what fuels my dedication to this course. I'm captivated by the way programming can influence and enhance experiences in these diverse fields.

Before enrolling in an established institute, I dabbled in self-learning during high school. However, the demanding schedule of school made it challenging to balance both passions. I decided to wait until after completing high school to fully immerse myself in the world of coding, and I haven't looked back since.

💡 I consider myself a futurist, always looking ahead and excited about the endless possibilities that technology and coding can bring to our world. Problem-solving and creating is at the heart of what I love to do, and I believe that the world of software development offers the perfect canvas for my creative and analytical mind.

Let's connect and create together. Feel free to reach out and explore the future with me!
